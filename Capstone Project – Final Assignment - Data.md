# Data

Based on our business problem ie. – “Identifying a suitable location to build a Shopping Mall in City of Mangalore.” we need following data.<br>
1.	We need a list of neighborhoods in Mangalore to identify locations with Residential buildings, Hotels, Colleges, parks, transportation etc.<br>
2.	We need the latitude and longitude coordination of these neighborhoods for different analysis and visualization. <br>
3.	Analyze the obtained data to identify the best locations for coming up with new Shopping Mall.<br>


## Data Source

Following are the data sources needed for the analysis<br>
1.	__Google Map__ to get coordinates of Mangalore City<br>
2.	__Wikipedia__ to collect information about different neighborhoods (wards) in Mangalore.<br>
3.	Using __Foursquare API's__ to find out the best location for the mall. Also analyze the different neighborhoods to find out the number of Residential building, Hotels, arks etc.<br>
4.	Will be using __Geopy Nominatim__ to get the latitude and longitude of different locations/Wards.<br>
5.	__Pandas__ will be used to clean up the data As we may have to _add/remove/fix_ coordinates of different locations/wards. Data collection and cleaning will be a important activity in this project as there may not be enough information available from one single source. <br>
